### What I learned

What I Learned While I Implemented the Room homepage challenge

- Translating the given UI designs into clean, responsive layout requires strong attention to detail and layout logic.
- Managing layout differences across screen sizes helped sharpen my skills with CSS Flexbox, and responsive design principles.
- Fine-tuning hover and focus states across devices improved my understanding of accessible UI patterns.
- Recreating a pixel-perfect layout demanded critical thinking and problem-solvingâ€”especially when aligning elements that behave differently across screen widths.
